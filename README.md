# Horoscope Generator
> I built a random horoscope generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they can input their sign and will get a new, randomized prediction and piece of advice. To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs is made up of at least three different pieces of data.

## General Information
- This fun project is to show case my intermeidate Javscript skills. I hope you enjoy it!

- Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.
- Project Objectives:
  - Build a message generator program using JavaScript
  - Use Git version control
  - Use command line
  - Local development
- This is a portfolio project to showcase intermediate Javascript, command line and version control skills.
- The purpose of this project is to take in the sign of the user and generate a randomized (and coherent) prediction and adivce for that sign.
- I started this project following the Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Path.
